School of SRE's goal is to provide open, accessible content for all working and aspiring SREs. We welcome translations in all languages.

We use [GitLocalise](https://gitlocalize.com/) for translations. It provides a nice UI for the translator, review tool for peer review, and easy sync back into the main repo in a structured format.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.gitlocalize.com/how_to_contribute.html) to get started.

In short, you have to pick a repo, the language and a file in the repo to start translating. Once you have completed translation, you can request a review. A moderator from our team will review your content, and either approve or provide suggestions for change.

Resolve all requested changes, and then the moderator will send a pull request to the repo to merge your contribution.

We require all content to be [markdown formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
